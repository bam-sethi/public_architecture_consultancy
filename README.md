Public Architecture Forum
-------------------------
This is the second project I did as part of my Web Development Course at General Assembly. The idea was to let users talk about the city they live in through its buildings. 

What is it?

This is a Rails app that hosts reviews of mostly new architectural developments in London. Users can review and add buildings of their choice. They can also come up with suggestions for how they think these buildings could be repurposed for a perhaps more social use with the ability to vote on these suggestions as I wrote in a Like Button.

I really enjoyed this Project, Rails gives you the opportunity to build something substantial with lots of different features. I found it fun and challenging moving between Ruby logic and JavaScript logic. I got see how useful Ruby on Rails can be for doing quick prototyping to longer term projects.
